<h1>About Project FortiDragon</h1>

<p><strong>Forged in education. Focused on protection.</strong><br>
Project FortiDragon: Empowering cybersecurity learning through real-world vulnerability tracking.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What is Project FortiDragon?</h2>
<p>
Project FortiDragon is a Flask-based web application created as part of an advanced programming course.
It demonstrates how web development and cybersecurity concepts can work together through a simple
vulnerability disclosure and tracking system.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
The goal of this project is to give students and developers hands-on experience building a secure
web application that manages vulnerability reports, supports user authentication, and uses a database
to store submissions. It reflects a practical approach to learning cybersecurity principles through real code.
</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Users can create accounts and log in securely.</li>
  <li>Authenticated users can submit vulnerability reports.</li>
  <li>Each report can include a title, description, severity, and mitigation steps.</li>
  <li>Admins or reviewers can view and manage the submitted reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Flask (Python web framework)</li>
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> SQLite for local data storage</li>
  <li><strong>Templates:</strong> Jinja2 (Flask’s built-in templating system)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>
Future versions of Project FortiDragon could connect to external APIs such as the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD), VirusTotal, or Jira to expand automation and
threat intelligence capabilities.
